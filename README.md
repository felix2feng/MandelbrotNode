# MandelbrotNode
Implementing Mandelbrot Set in Node.js using clusters in a parralel form. Some inspiration has been taken from [Craig Nicol's implementation](https://craignicol.wordpress.com/2014/07/29/the-node-js-mandelbrot-set/).

## Features
- Visualized in matrix form in the console
- Allows for 3 choices of partitioning: squareRegion, courseGrainRowRegion, dynamicRowRegion
- Basic tests using the expect library

## Getting Started
Run npm install and node server.js to get it up and running
